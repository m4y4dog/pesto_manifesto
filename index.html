<h1>the pesto manifesto</h1>
<p>this is the pesto manifesto: an improvised recipe of sorts

<p>when making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>

<p>1. must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce. </p>
        <p>2. must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.</p>
        <p>3. must use pine nuts.</p>
   <p> 4. no food processing allowed.</p>

<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made RIGHT. Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! or should it?</p>

        <p>1. become inspired by mediocre productions. </p>
        <p>2. don’t covert production and experimentation recipe</p>
        <p>3. always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves </p>
        <p>4. a photoshop’d joke is DEEP and MEANINGFUL</p>
<p>5. take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe </p>
    <p>6. follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate and resurrect MEANING</p>

        <p>keep in mind:</p>

        <p>pesto is delicious when it’s made FRESH.</p>
